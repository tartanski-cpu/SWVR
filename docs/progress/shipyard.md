# Progress: The Shipyard

The running record for this area's chat: the Shipyard web app: designing a boat, her code, her build and trial. From 23 Oct 2026 each area keeps its own log here, so the chats don't all edit one file (see CLAUDE.md, "Working in areas"). The shared decisions, the roadmap and the history before that date stay in `PROGRESS.md`.

- **This area's files:** `src/shipyard/`, `shipyard.html`; settings in `src/config/shipyard.ts`.
- **Its tests while working:** `npm run test:shipyard`. Run `npm test` (everything) before moving work on to `next`.
- **Its address to try:** https://tartanski-cpu.github.io/SWVR/preview/shipyard/ (branch `preview/shipyard`).

Newest entry first. Each change set: what changed and why, the config keys, the tests, and what was and wasn't checked.

## Changes

### Rework, part 1 of 3: the Shipyard opens on a project (done, awaiting owner test)

Owner, 23 Oct 2026: "every time I go back to the page, it seems to remember all of those things in the previous design ... when you load in, it's basically empty, you don't have a project, so it cleans all the settings. And then it says, do you want to make a new project or open an existing one?" The plan agreed for the whole rework: 1) start with a project; 2) hull-type cards with what each is for, instead of the paper brief (its targets kept, folded away; "exploring" as a tag only for now; rendered side views); 3) placing gear and furniture directly, a green or red copy following the mouse, no pins or placement messages.

- **The start screen** (page.ts `showStartScreen`, shipyard.html `#yardStart`): a new project (her name), a saved one (Open, Delete), or a new one from a favourite. Nothing of the last design is on the table until you choose.
- **A tab with a project open** is marked in the tab's own storage (`swvr.yard.open`, sessionStorage): a reload keeps the work open; coming back to the Shipyard later (a new tab or visit) starts at the start screen.
- **Projects save themselves** (`autosaveProject`, with every save of the working copy, 0.8 s after a change): no Save button. Her picture is retaken at most once a minute (it takes a render), and on closing. Renamed at the top, the project takes the new name (projects.ts `saveAs`), not a second copy. **Close project** (📁 Projects) saves it and goes back to the start screen. Opening another from 📁 Projects keeps this one (as before).
- **Work left from before** (the old autosaved design): on opening afresh it goes back into its project, or becomes a project "Unsaved work (date)" (projects.ts `keepLeftWork`), so nothing is lost; then the table is cleared.
- **Her code is no longer kept in the page's address** (it made a reload read as a link to a new boat). A link or code opens as a new project, and is taken off the address once read. Sharing builds its own link, as before.
- **Designing together** is unchanged: a session link opens the session, no start screen, nothing autosaved into projects.
- **Checked:** tests/shipyard/projectStart.test.ts (saving again updates; a rename moves the project; left work back into its project, or "Unsaved work"). Headless Chromium, the whole flow: an old browser's work kept as "Unsaved work" and the start screen shown; a new project named; a change saved into it; a reload keeps it open; Close project back to the start screen; opened again with its change; a new tab shows the start screen. `npm run test:shipyard` and the typecheck pass. **Not checked:** the Quest's browser; designing together with this change.
- **Shared changes:** none (README's Projects paragraph only).
